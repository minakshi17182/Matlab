# Matlab

1. Generate a sinusodal sequence with sampling frequency Fs=b
1000
N
c, bc is
floor function. N is last two digits of your roll number. For example if
your roll number is : 2016yy or 2017yy, then N = yy
2. Plot sin(x) vs cos(x) graph with axes font ‘Times New Roman’, fontsize
‘20 ’and properly labelled axes. Mention all the specifications in MATLAB
code. ‘x ’to be taken in range [−π π].
3. For a series RLC circuit, plot impedance ‘Z ’vs frequency plot (f), reactances
‘X0
c and ‘X0
l
vs frequency plot (f ). Values of R=yy Ohms, as
discussed in Question 1, L = 0.01 H, and C = 10−6 F. Range of frequency
to be used [0 1000] Hz with step size of 10.
4. Plot magnitude and phase responses of Butterworth low pass filter. Use
the equations for magnitude and phase of transfer function of filter from
slides.
